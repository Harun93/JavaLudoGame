Ludo Game
Ludo is a board game for two to four players, in which the players race their four tokens from start to finish according to dice rolls

Game Rules
Each throw, the player decides which piece to move. A piece simply moves in a clockwise direction around the track given by the number thrown. If no piece can legally move according to the number thrown, play passes to the next player.

A throw of 6 gives another turn.

A player must throw a 6 to move a piece from the starting circle onto the first square on the track. The piece moves 6 squares around the circuit beginning with the appropriately coloured start square (and the player then has another turn).

If a piece lands on a piece of a different colour, the piece jumped upon is returned to its starting area. If a piece lands upon a piece of the same colour, this forms a block. This block cannot be passed or landed on by any opposing piece.

Winning

When a piece has circumnavigated the board, it proceeds up the home column. A piece can only be moved onto the home area by an exact throw.

The first person to move all 4 pieces into the home area wins.
